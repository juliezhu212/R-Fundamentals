## Learning Objectives

Welcome to Part 2 of the R Fundamentals series. Our goals for today's workshop are:

1.  Recall what a vector is and define a data frame.

2.  Learn what functions are and how to use them.

3.  Use read.csv to import data.

Throughout this workshop series, we will use the following icons:

🔔 **Question**: A quick question to help you understand what's going on.

🥊 **Challenge**: Interactive exercise. We'll go through these in the workshop!

⚠️ **Warning**: Heads-up about tricky stuff or common mistakes.

💡 **Tip**: How to do something a bit more efficiently or effectively.

📝 **Poll**: A zoom poll to help you learn.

🎬 **Demo**: Showing off something more advanced so you know what you can use R for in the future

## Vector Recap

In Part 1 we learned how to create vectors using the `c()` function.

```{r}
# create a vector storing 5 year from 2018 to 2022
years <- c(2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022)
```

We can perform mathematical operations to the elements in the vector.

```{r}
# population in Mexico from 2018-2022 in millions
pop_mexico <- c(123, 124, 125, 126, 127)

# show it in 100,000s
pop_mexico*10

# add 2 to each element
pop_mexico + 2
```

### 🥊 Challenge 1: Manipulating Vectors

The code above didn't permanently change the values in our population vector. Re-write the code above so that the population vector is an additional 2 (million) people in each year.

```{r}

pop_mexico <- pop_mexico + 2
pop_mexico
```

## Functions

Beyond mathematical operations, we can apply **functions** to vectors, for example the function `length()`.

```{r}
length(pop_mexico)
```

Functions are commands that take an input and return some output. They are identified by the trailing brackets. Inside the brackets you'll put:

1.  **input** - the object that the function is operating on.

2.  **arguments** - modifications we make to the function (the first argument is usually the input).

🔔 **Tip:** What is the **input** for the `length()` function?

```{r}
length(pop_mexico)
```

⚠️ **Warning:** Not all functions have inputs or arguments - for example, the `ls()` function doesn't require an input but still gives us an output.

```{r}
ls()
```

We can modify functions by changing the **arguments** in the function. The function `seq()` has several arguments, which we can look at on the help page.

```{r}
# look up what the seq() functions does and what arguments it uses
?seq
```

📝 **Poll RFun 2-1:** Looking at the `seq()` help page, which code is correct for creating a vector with the years 2018 to 2022? Try the code out in the poll below and answer in the Zoom poll.

```{r}

# years vector using c()
years <- c(2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022)

# try using seq() to create the same vector as above, called years_v2
years_v2 <- seq(from=2018, to=2022)

# default increment is 1
seq(from=2018, to=2022, by=1)

# length should be 5, default increment is 1
seq(from=2018, to=2022, length.out=5)

# length same as length of `years`, default increment is 1
seq(from=2018, to=2022, along.with=years)
```

```{r}
# check that the two population vectors are the same length
length(years)
length(years_v2)
```

A third way to create a vector is using the `:` operator (colon operator).

```{r}
years_v3 <- c(2018:2022)
```

```{r}
# `:` works for increment of -1
c(2022:2018)

# same as seq(from=??, to=??)
?colon
```

💡 **Tip:** It's okay to try out functions and operators and get things wrong! Interpreting error messages and debugging code is the bread and butter of coding.

## Data Frames

**Vectors** are variables that store multiple values of the same type (all numbers or all words). Most of the time, we want to work with data that have multiple variables - we call this **multidimensional data**. In R, we use **data frames** to store multidimensional data.

In the R language, a data frame is an object containing multiple vectors of the same length. The values in a given vector are all the same type, but the vectors may each hold a different type of value. In everyday language, a data frame is a collection of variables (columns). Each variable contains the same number of observations (rows).

### 🥊 Challenge 2: Your Own Data

Think of an example of data you have worked with. What are the observations (the unit of measurement)? What are the variables (the information being measured)? **Write your answer in the chat, but don't hit send until I say go...**

⚠️ **Warning:** Data frames are not the only way to store multidimensional data in R - but they are the most common and easiest to work with.

## Import Data

You can create a data frame in R and fill it with values. Normally though, you **import** data and save it as a data frame. You can import many different types of files into R (eg. excel sheets, csv files, dta files). Today we will import a csv file.

📝 **Poll RFun 2-2:** What file type does the data you work with usually come in?

```{r}
# import csv file 
gap <- read.csv("gapminder.csv")
```

🔔 **Question:** The code above returned an error - why do you think this is?

When we read in data, we need to specify the **relative file path**. This means, from our **current working directory**, navigating our file structure to get to the file we want to import.

Imagine the file path on your computer as the exact address to a specific room in a sprawling mansion. The mansion has multiple floors, each with a variety of rooms: bedrooms, kitchens, and libraries. To find your way to a specific room, you would start at the front entrance (the root directory), then move up staircases or down hallways (subdirectories) until you reach your destination.

Just as you might give a friend detailed instructions like "enter the mansion, go up to the second floor, turn left, take the third door on the right," a file path provides the computer with precise directions to locate a specific file amid thousands of other files. This way, the computer knows exactly where to go to find what you're looking for.

In the following piece of code, we are saying: "Go up one directory/folder from the current working directory, then go into the"data" directory, then open "gapminder.csv".

```{r}
# print out our current working directory
getwd()

# read in gap data using a relative file path
gap <- read.csv("../data/gapminder.csv")
```

💡 **Tip:** Within a file path, a period "." means "in this directory". A double period ".." means "go back one directory".

⚠️ **Warning:** In R Notebooks, the working directory is always the directory in which the notebook is saved. All data that needs to be read, needs to be located relative to that directory. In R Scripts, you can change the working directory at the start of your script by using the `setwd()` function.

After importing data, the first thing to check is if the data looks like you expected it to.

```{r}
# examine our data
?head

# head shows top 6 rows
head(gap)
```

```{r}
head(gap, n=2)
```

```{r}
tail(gap, n=3)
```

### 🥊 Challenge 3: Import a csv file and explore the data

Clear the global environment (hint: if you can't remember the function to do this, you can use the broom icon). Read in the Gapminder data (it's in the Data directory) and save it to an object called **gap**.

Then use the functions `head()`, `dim()`, and `View()` (note the capital V) to answer the following questions:

1.  How many variables are there? 6 cols

2.  How many observations are there? 1704 rows

3.  What information is in this data? Population, life expectancy, GDP per capita

```{r}
# clear the global environment
rm(list=ls())

# read in the gapminder data and save as an object called "gap"
gap <- read.csv("../data/gapminder.csv")

# use the functions head(), dim(), and View() 
# eg. head(gap)
head(gap)

# dimension returns # rows, # cols
dim(gap)

# display full dataframe in new window
# similar to clicking on `gap` in environment
View(gap)
```

💡 **Tip:** Oftentimes, different file types have different functions for importing them. To import a specific file type, you can Google or ask ChatGPT what package and function is needed. E.g., packages for less common file types are `foreign` and `haven`.

## Classes of data

When we created variables in Part 1, we said that all the values in the variable needed to be the same type or **class**. Let's explore the variables in the gap data frame a bit more. We can select individual variables using the `$` operator.

```{r}
# select population
gap$pop

# if you type gap$ it will show you a list of variables
# if you start typing one and hit "tab" it will tab complete for you
gap
```

The variables in our data frame have different classes. Lets use the `class()` operator to see this.

```{r}
# use the class() function to check the class of population
class(gap$pop)

# now country 
class(gap$country)
```

🔔 **Question:** Why is the class of `pop` a **numeric** class, and the class of `country` a **character** class?

```{r}
# check if all numeric-looking variables have the same class
class(gap$year)
```

🔔 **Question:** Why do you think `year` has class **integer** but `pop` has class **numeric**?

Overall, there are five classes of data in R:

1.  **numeric**: decimals (the default for ALL numbers in R)

2.  **integer**: whole numbers (positive and negative, including zero)

3.  **character**: text strings (always wrapped in quotations)

4.  **logical**: TRUE or FALSE (1 or 0)

5.  **factor**: nominal or ordinal categorical type

⚠️ **Warning:** We have learned the first three classes. We will encounter **logicals** and **factors** later in the series.

📝 **Poll RFun 2-3**: Use the function `class()` on each of the following variables and match them with their class: `continent`, `lifeExp`, `gdpPercap`, `year`

```{r}

class(gap$continent)
class(gap$lifeExp)
class(gap$gdpPercap)
class(gap$year)
```

```{r}
# same as <??> in head
head(gap, n=1)
```

## Subsetting Data Frames

We often want to work with **subsets** of our data. A subset is a portion or slice of our data. It could be a subset of rows, for example, if we wanted to see all rows for the country Argentina. It could also be a subset of columns - for example, if we wanted to see only population and year. It could also be a combination of rows and columns. We do this by **indexing**.

Indexing refers to specifying the rows or columns that we want to extract from an object. It is done using **square brackets**. For a single vector, we extract a specific element by providing the index of that value (index means its place in the vector).

```{r}
# create a vector with years from 2000 to 2010 
years <- 2000:2010
years

# extract the 5th element of that vector
years[5]

# extract the 12th element of that vector - what happens?
years[12]
```

Because data frames are two-dimensional, we can specify the rows and the columns we want. The format is: **data.frame[rows, columns]**. By leaving either rows or columns blank, that selects all of them.

To extract a single variable, we specify the variable name withing the square brackets. This returns all the rows but only one column.

```{r}
# 1 col: extract a single variable using the indexing method 
gap["pop"]
```

```{r}
# $ method returns vector 
# appears under Environment `Values`
# choose 1 col
pop_v1 <- gap$pop
pop_v1

# indexing method returns df
# appears under Environment `Data`
# choose mutliple rows, cols
pop_v2 <- gap["pop"]
pop_v2
```

We can index **multiple** columns. This is done by providing a vector of variable names inside the square brackets.

```{r}
# multiple cols: extract multiple variables using the indexing method
gap[c("pop", "year")]

# we can also define the vector of names first
variables <- c("pop" , "year", "lifeExp")
gap[variables]
```

```{r}
# extract column names
names(gap)
```

### 🥊 Challenge 4: Subsetting Columns

Extract three variables of your choice from the gap data frame. Think back to Part 1 when we learned the assignment operator `<-`. See if you can assign these three extracted variables to a new data frame called **gap_subset**.

```{r}

gap_subset_1 <- gap[c("country", "year", "pop")]
gap_subset_1
```

```{r}
# index first 5 rows, 2 cols
gap_subset_2 <- gap[1:5, c("country", "year")]
gap_subset_2
```

```{r}
# $ method to select cols, then create df to organize the cols
gap_subset <- data.frame(gap$country, gap$pop, gap$year)
head(gap_subset)
```

## 🎬 **Demo:** Next Time...

Besides subsetting columns, we can subset rows. To do this, we use **conditional statements** to tell R which rows we want to return.

🔔 **Question:** Run the chunk of code below. What do you think we are doing?

```{r}
# use tidyverse for conditional selection
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
gap %>%
  filter(year == 2007 | year == 1952) %>%
  select(gdpPercap, lifeExp, continent, year) 
```

## Key Points

-   Many types of data files can be read into R and saved as **data frames**

-   Variables can be different classes (type), common classes are **numeric**, **integers** and **characters**

-   In **base R**, use indexing to subset the data by specifying the rows and columns we want in square brackets

-   We used the functions `length()`, `seq()`, `read.csv()`, `head()`, `dim()`, `View()`, and `class()`
